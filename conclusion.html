    <h2>
        HOW TO CONTROL FOOD WASTAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
        Most people don't realize how much food they throw away every day â€” from uneaten leftovers to spoiled produce to parts of fruits and vegetables that could be eaten or repurposed.

One-third of all food in the United States goes uneaten. EPA estimates that in 2019, about 96 percent of households' wasted food ended up in landfills, combustion facilities, or down the drain to the sewer system. The remainder was composted.1

Preventing food from going to waste is one of the easiest and most powerful actions you can take to save money and lower your climate change footprint by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits of Preventing Wasted Food at Home</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Save money:  by buying only what you need, eating what you buy, and avoiding throwing away food.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conserve resource and energy: When food is wasted, the land, water, energy, and other inputs that are used in producing, processing, transporting, preparing, storing, and disposing the food are wasted as well.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce GHG emissions: More than 85 percent of GHG emissions from landfilled food waste result from activities prior to food entering a landfill, including the production, transport, processing, and distribution of food.2 Plus, when food decomposes in a landfill, methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted. Municipal solid waste landfills are the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the U.S. and food waste is responsible for 58% of landfill emissions.</li>
