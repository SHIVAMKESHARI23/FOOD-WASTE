    <h1 style="text-align: center;">FOOD WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
   <Pre> Food waste management relates to the stages of prevention, recovery, recycling, or food waste disposal that follows. 

This includes:

1.Food waste tracking and prevention 
2.Food banks 
3.Using food as animal feed
4.Creating renewable energy through anaerobic digestion
5.Composting
6.Landfills
</Pre>

<div class="track">
<ol> 
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Food waste tracking and prevention:</h><p>Food tracking can help you identify your healthy habits, such as choosing nutritious snacks, and habits that need improving, such as drinking too many sugary drinks.</p></li>
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Food banks:</h></li><p>A place where food is given to people who do not have enough money to buy it, for example by a charity.</p></li>
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Using food as animal feed:</h><p>Preparing the sterilized dry solid food mass for use as animal feed. sterilizing the food waste by exposing the food waste simultaneously to convectional heat and microwave energy to kill pathogens in the food waste whereby a protein-rich animal feed is available.</p></li>
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Creating renewable energy through anaerobic digestion:</h><p>Digestion – Now pasteurised, the waste is fed into the anaerobic digester. As with composting, bacteria break down the waste, converting it into biogas and a residue, which is called digestate. Energy – Gas piped from the digester is used to generate electricity and heat.</p></li>
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Composting:</h><p>Composting is the natural process of recycling organic matter, such as leaves and food scraps, into a valuable fertilizer that can enrich soil and plants.</p></li>
<li><h style="font-size: 170%;">Landfills:</h><p>Landfills are locations where disposable materials are sent, which are then buried underground. During this process, precautions are taken to prevent the Waste from reaching and potentially contaminating any groundwater.</p></li>

    <h2 style="text-transform:uppercase;">Stages of food waste management</h2>
    <p>
The most important stage of food waste management is reducing the waste of edible food. Traditionally, tracking food waste hasn’t been a priority for commercial kitchens.The majority simply don’t know  how much food they’re actually throwing away, and in turn how much money is wasted. Even if they do, most kitchens are limited to rudimentary food waste tracking spreadsheets, which take up valuable staff time and result in inaccurate data. This causes most businesses to vastly underestimate their food waste. For hospitality businesses, it’s critical to have a robust food waste tracking process in place to, reduce their carbon footprint and save money. Thankfully, technology has enabled a new era for food waste management, often in the form of software enabled with hardware to fit the rugged kitchen environment.

        <p>When it comes to reducing food waste in kitchens, management play a key role in establishing a culture of waste prevention.There are six ways businesses can deal with food waste, which are prioritised  by the food recovery hierarchy Source reduction.  Minimising the amount of food you're buying or reducing the number of items on a menu.Feed hungry people. Helping your community by donating food to food banks, soup kitchens, or shelters.Feed animals. Helping to sustain the local farming industries to help turn scraps from your kitchen into animal food.Industrial uses. Working with local councils to repurpose kitchen items. Wasted oils can be rendered and turned into a sustainable fuel source, while food scraps can be anaerobically digested and help create energy. Composting. Repurposing food waste a compost with local crop producers in your community.Incineration or landfill. This is not sustainable or environmentally friendly. Measures should be taken to avoid this action for all food waste.</p>

    <h4 style="text-transform: uppercase;";>Management of Waste</h4>
    <p>With technology replacing the vast majority of the data collection process, managing waste is now a straightforward five-step process. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Food is thrown into the designated food waste bin.</li>
        <li>The weight of the waste is logged from the scale under the bin, and the food type is captured on camera. </li>
            <li>This process is repeated over the course of the day and has the capability to include cooking errors, overproduction, trimmings, and plate waste.</li>
        <li>The data is sent to the cloud where it is aggregated, it includes the financial and environmental costs of the wasted food, time of day, and areas in production of high waste. Chefs can view the waste the next day. </li>
        <li>With this insight available in an actionable format, the chefs can now make operational decisions in the kitchen to reduce waste.</li>
