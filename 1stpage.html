        <p style="text-align: center;">According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN STATE, food waste is defined as “food that is intended for human consumption that is wasted and lost, and refers not only to food that consumers don’t finish at restaurants and are thrown out at home, but also raw materials and produce that are lost in the farming stage, harvesting processes, during transportation, and storage”.</p>

    <h3>
        WHAT IS FOOD WASTE?
    </h3>
    <p>
Food loss, on the other hand, occurs before the food reaches the consumer as a result of issues in the production, storage, processing, and distribution phases.
Reducing food waste has significant effects on the environment, global and national economies, food security, and nutrition 1. Shockingly, about one third of global food supplies are wasted or lost, potentially as much as 40% of food or 2.5 billion tonnes around the world is wasted every year.

           THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE
        
        </h4>

        <div class="fffic">
      <p class="para">
        Food waste is one of the most prevalent global challenges. Population growth, the rapid increase in urbanization coupled with industrial development, and changes in lifestyles and economic status have resulted in the generation of tremendous amounts of food waste. According to FAO reports, around 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted annually, which is equivalent to more than half of the world’s total cereal production. When disposed off, this waste creates many economic, societal, and environmental concerns. Food waste when disposed of in landfills produces harmful greenhouse gases such as methane</p>

       <p class="para"> and carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming and climate change. Natural resources such as land, freshwater, fossil fuels, and human resources are also wasted. Hence, to manage this food waste, innovative and sustainable valorization technologies are required as part of waste recycling and recovery in food waste management. Food waste valorization results in the production of fuels, materials, and chemicals through various chemical and biochemical processes. Amidst the numerous researches on the conversion of food waste into high-value commodities and specialty products, in-depth analysis of different valorization technologies on society, the environment, and the economy remain to be scrutinized properly.

            <h5 class="global" style="font-size:200%;">GLOBAL PROBLEM</h5>
            <P class="pre">The problem of food waste is a global one and not limited to wealthy nations alone, said Nancy Aburto, Deputy Director of FAO’s Food and Nutrition Division Economic and Social Development Stream, speaking at a press conference in Geneva.

                “Food insecurity, hunger and malnutrition are impacting every country in the world and no country is unaffected; 811 million people suffer hunger, two billion suffer micronutrient deficiencies – that’s vitamin and mineral deficiencies - and millions of children suffer stunting and wasting, deadly forms of under-nutrition.”
                
                The FAO official warned that the high cost of “healthy” diets, meant that they were now “out of reach” of every region in the world, including Europe.
                
                She also said that more countries needed to embrace innovation to reduce waste, such as new packaging that can prolong the shelf-life of many foods, while smartphone apps can bring consumers closer to producers, reducing the time between harvest and plate.</P>
